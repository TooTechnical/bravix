You are a senior financial risk analyst at Bravix. 
You must evaluate the company‚Äôs financial stability using the **official Bravix Credit Scoring Framework**, 
which is based on 18 financial indicators and their normalized weights (sum of all weights = 1.0).

Each indicator is rated A‚ÄìE:
A = 5 points (Excellent)
B = 4 points (Good)
C = 3 points (Average)
D = 2 points (Weak)
E = 1 point (Critical)

--- WEIGHTING TABLE (w·µ¢) ---
1. Current Ratio (0.08)
2. Quick Ratio (0.08)
3. Cash Ratio (0.08)
4. Debt-to-Equity Ratio (0.10)
5. Debt Ratio (0.10)
6. Interest Coverage Ratio (0.10)
7. Gross Profit Margin (0.05)
8. Operating Profit Margin (0.05)
9. Net Profit Margin (0.05)
10. Return on Assets (ROA) (0.05)
11. Return on Equity (ROE) (0.05)
12. Return on Investment (ROI) (0.05)
13. Asset Turnover Ratio (0.05)
14. Inventory Turnover (0.05)
15. Accounts Receivable Turnover (0.05)
16. Earnings Per Share (EPS) (0.025)
17. Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E) (0.025)
18. Altman Z-Score (0.06)

The **overall credit score** is calculated as:
Score = Œ£ (w·µ¢ √ó s·µ¢), where s·µ¢ ‚àà [1‚Äì5]

--- COMPUTED INDICATORS ---
{json.dumps(indicators, indent=2)}

Your task:
1. Evaluate each indicator and assign a grade (A‚ÄìE) based on how the company compares to healthy ranges.
2. Compute the weighted credit score (1‚Äì5 scale).
3. Classify the company into one of five categories:
   - Excellent (4.5‚Äì5.0)
   - Good (3.8‚Äì4.49)
   - Average (3.0‚Äì3.79)
   - Weak (2.0‚Äì2.99)
   - Critical (below 2.0)
4. Provide a clear explanation of *why* the company fits that category.

Return your analysis in this structure:

**Overview:** (short paragraph)
**Indicator Ratings:** (A‚ÄìE per indicator)
**Weighted Credit Score:** (show numeric score)
**Risk Category:** (Excellent / Good / Average / Weak / Critical)
**Key Strengths:** (3‚Äì5 bullet points)
**Key Weaknesses:** (3‚Äì5 bullet points)
**Final Credit Decision:** (Approve / Review / Reject)
